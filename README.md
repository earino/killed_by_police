So this is my first EDA on this new data set, I downloaded the data from
killedbypolice.net and after some wrangling, I think I've turned it into 
an actual usable data set. For what yet, I dont' know.

At the end of this knitr document i create some csv files and a graph that
shows that the north east is way less eager to kill population than the south
west.

data sets:

* [full cleaned data](data/cleaned.csv)
* [summary by state](data/summaries_by_state.csv)
* [summary_by_state_and_race](data/summaries_by_state_and_race.csv)

You can also embed plots, for example:

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png) 

Note you're most likely to get killed by police on Monday:


```r
ggplot(data, aes(x=as.factor(wday))) + geom_histogram()
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png) 

The probability of being killed by a police officer falls off drastically
as men age, seems to stay more constant for longer for women (even though there
is less data, as women are simply killed less often):


```r
ggplot(data[complete.cases(data),], aes(x=age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=10) + facet_wrap(~ gender, scales="free") + ggtitle("Violence by Police by Gender")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figure/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png) 

The south is active year round isn't it


```r
data$region = state.region[match(state.name[data$state], state.name)]

ggplot(data, aes(x=date)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2563200, color="black", fill="white") + facet_wrap(~ region) + ggtitle("Deaths by Police Across Time by Region") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](figure/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png) 

Surprised that police interactions peak in may and august:


```r
ggplot(data[complete.cases(data),] %>% filter(race == "B" | race == "W" | race == "L"), aes(x=as.factor(mday))) + 
  geom_histogram(fill="white", color="black") + 
  facet_grid(month~race) + ggtitle("Killed by Month by Day of Month")
```
