Leavenworth officers fired at the suspect, Marcas McGowan, after he
led police on a chase with Cadence in his vehicle and then
allegedly pointed a handgun at the officers... (Cadence was found
dead of a gunshot in McGowan's vehicle.) The murder charge against
McGowan, filed in Leavenworth County District Court, alleges that
he is responsible for the death because it occurred while he
committed the crimes of fleeing from police and endangering a
child. He is not accused of intentionally killing Cadence, the
daughter of his girlfriend, who was taken after a domestic
disturbance from the home they shared in Atchison, Kansas.""http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article788075.html
